# About Heroku
For free accounts Heroku provides [550 dyno hours PER MONTH](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours). One time visits counts to 30 minute (1/2 hours) of dyno hours. If we made some changes in github repo, we need to go to heroku website and deploy the branch again. If we no longer need to run an app we can do this `Dashboard => Your App Name => Resources => Pencil icon=> Flip the switch => Confirm`.
